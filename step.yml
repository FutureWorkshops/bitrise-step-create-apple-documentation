  Objective-C and Swift are supported, but there is no declared supported for mixed language projects.
  This was created with the goal to export as a reach HTML documents for Frameworks.

# If this step should be available only for certain project types
# just uncomment this `project_type_tags` section and include all the
# project types supported by the step. If the step can be used for all
# project types then you can just remove this section.
# If no `project_type_tags` specified (or specified as an empty array)
# that means the step can be used for any project type.
# You can find more information about project type tags in the Step Development Guideline:

project_type_tags:

# Type tags are used for categorizing steps, for easier step discovery in Step Libraries.
